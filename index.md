## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lap 8 Part 2

    I like how in this Lab we were able to calculate the average score. Just as it says in the instructions you're putting in any kind of scores, let it be decimals or integers, it’ll always calculate the average score between all of them and doing something like that always interests me because of how the code calculates the average scores.

* Lab 7 Part 1

    This lab was definitely my hardest lab as I had to basically implement parking restrictions which was difficult for me to comprehend as I had to write the code that automated parking rules. We did 4 different streets and although it was hard at first once I started seeing the pattern to it, it got pretty easy and I enjoyed the lab as it was my hardest lab.

* Lab 3 Part 2

    Although it's a very simple Lab that we did, I found it very useful as it is technically a BMR calculator that I personally made, and if ever in the future I could use this. I just loved doing this lab because it showed me how I can also program to make certain calculators and just basically have my own personal BMR calculator without having to rely on some other websites.
